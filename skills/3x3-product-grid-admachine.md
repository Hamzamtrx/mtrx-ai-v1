# 3x3 PRODUCT GRID PROMPT — AD MACHINE LEVEL

**Purpose:** Generate a single composite image showing 9 angles of the same product in a 3x3 grid layout.

---

## THE PROMPT

```
Professional commercial product photography composite. 3x3 grid layout showing 9 different angles of the SAME product.

REFERENCE IMAGE (CRITICAL — NON-NEGOTIABLE):
Use the uploaded product image as EXACT reference. CLONE the product design precisely for ALL 9 frames — same colors, same graphics, same text, same proportions. Every frame shows the SAME product from a different angle. Do NOT modify, reimagine, or "improve" the design in any frame.

PRODUCT:
Flexible stand-up mylar pouch supplement packaging. THIN profile — this is flexible film packaging, NOT a rigid box. Shows natural soft creases from flexible material. When viewed from side, the pouch is NARROW (1-2 inches).

GRID LAYOUT (3 rows × 3 columns):

ROW 1 (TOP):
[Top-Left] FRONT HERO — Straight-on front view. Product centered, standing upright. Camera perpendicular to front face.
[Top-Center] FRONT HERO VARIANT — Straight-on front view with very slight rotation (5°). Nearly identical to top-left.
[Top-Right] 3/4 RIGHT VIEW — Product rotated 30° showing front face at angle + thin right side edge visible.

ROW 2 (MIDDLE):
[Middle-Left] 3/4 LEFT VIEW — Product rotated 30° showing front face at angle + thin left side edge visible.
[Middle-Center] TOP DOWN VIEW — Camera directly above looking down at the top seal/opening of pouch. Shows the width of the sealed top edge.
[Middle-Right] SIDE PROFILE — Pure side view showing the thin depth of the flexible pouch. Very narrow profile visible.

ROW 3 (BOTTOM):
[Bottom-Left] FRONT HERO — Same as top-left. Straight-on front view.
[Bottom-Center] BACK PANEL — Showing the back of the pouch with nutrition facts label, barcode, ingredients list.
[Bottom-Right] FLAT LAY — Product laying down flat on its side, camera at slight angle. Shows the pouch in relaxed/reclined position.

BACKGROUND:
ALL 9 frames have identical pure white (#FFFFFF) seamless background. No gradients. Consistent soft shadow beneath each product.

LIGHTING:
Identical soft diffused studio lighting across all 9 frames. Soft directional light from upper-left creating gentle shadows. Consistent exposure and color temperature in every frame.

GRID STRUCTURE:
• Equal spacing between all 9 frames
• Thin white border/gap separating each frame
• All 9 products same scale relative to their frame
• Clean, organized, professional product catalog layout

PRODUCT FIDELITY (CRITICAL — NON-NEGOTIABLE):
• Design IDENTICAL across all 9 frames — same exact product
• ALL text LEGIBLE and CORRECTLY SPELLED in every frame
• Colors consistent: teal base, pink/green/yellow splatters, purple bottom
• Flexible pouch shows natural material properties — soft creases, thin profile
• Back panel shows realistic nutrition facts layout (if visible)

CAMERA/TECHNICAL:
• Product photography studio setup
• Each frame shot at equivalent of 85mm lens
• Sharp focus on product in every frame
• Color-accurate, no color cast

NOT (FORBIDDEN IN ALL FRAMES):
• Modified or reimagined design
• Different products in different frames
• Rigid box shape (this is FLEXIBLE packaging)
• Thick/puffy/inflated pouch appearance
• Harsh shadows or uneven lighting between frames
• Colored backgrounds
• Props or additional elements
• Inconsistent product scale between frames
• Blurry or illegible text
• Hallucinated/invented graphics or text

## USAGE NOTES

**Platform:** Nano Banana Pro (or similar)
**Aspect Ratio:** 1:1 (square) works best for 3x3 grid
**Reference:** Upload a clean front-facing product shot as reference

**What to expect:**
- Single composite image with 9 frames
- All frames show same product at different angles
- Consistent lighting/background across frames
- Some text may be slightly imperfect (AI limitation)

**Known limitations:**
- Back panel nutrition facts will be hallucinated (AI invents ingredients)
- Side profile may appear slightly thicker than real product
- Minor design variations may occur between frames

## SIMPLIFIED VERSION (if full prompt too long)

```
Professional product photography. 3x3 grid composite showing 9 angles of the SAME flexible mylar pouch.

REFERENCE: Clone the uploaded product design EXACTLY in all 9 frames.

GRID LAYOUT:
Row 1: Front hero | Front hero (slight angle) | 3/4 right view
Row 2: 3/4 left view | Top down view | Side profile
Row 3: Front hero | Back panel | Flat lay (laying down)

All frames: Pure white background, soft studio lighting, identical product scale.

CRITICAL: Same product in every frame. Thin flexible pouch — NOT a rigid box. All text legible.

NOT: Different products, modified design, thick/puffy pouch, colored backgrounds, props.
```

## STATUS: VALIDATED ✅

**Test Date:** January 29, 2026
**Platform:** Higgsfield
**Result:** All 9 angles generated correctly

**Key Success Factor:** 
The grid format with explicit LABELS for each position ("FRONT HERO", "3/4 RIGHT VIEW", etc.) gives AI much clearer instructions than individual angle prompts. Angles that failed individually (3/4 Right, Flat Lay) worked perfectly in grid context.

**Recommendation:** 
Always use grid approach for product reference images. Generate once, use as master reference for all aesthetic prompts.
