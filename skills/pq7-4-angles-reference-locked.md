# PQ7 PRODUCT ANGLES - REFERENCE-LOCKED PROMPTS

**Approach: Force AI to copy reference exactly, only change angle**

---

## PROMPT 1: FRONT HERO

```
Professional commercial product photography.

REFERENCE IMAGE (CRITICAL — NON-NEGOTIABLE):
Use the uploaded product image as the EXACT and ONLY reference. Copy ALL design elements precisely:
• Exact colors
• Exact graphics and splatter patterns  
• Exact text and typography
• Exact logo placement
• Exact proportions
Do NOT interpret, modify, reimagine, or "improve" the design. CLONE it exactly.

PRODUCT FORM:
Flexible stand-up gusseted supplement pouch. THIN and FLAT flexible packaging — NOT inflated, NOT puffy, NOT rigid. Shows natural soft creases and folds typical of real mylar/foil pouch packaging. Approximately 7 inches tall, 5 inches wide, thin profile when viewed from side.

ANGLE:
Front hero shot. Product standing upright on surface. Front face parallel to camera, all branding visible. Camera at product eye-level with subtle 3° upward tilt for heroic presence. Product centered in frame.

BACKGROUND:
Pure white (#FFFFFF) seamless infinity backdrop. No gradients, no texture, no shadows on background.

LIGHTING:
Soft diffused key light from upper left at 45°. Fill light from right at 25% intensity. Subtle rim light for edge definition. Soft shadow beneath product grounding it to surface. No harsh shadows.

CRITICAL — NON-NEGOTIABLE:
• Design must MATCH REFERENCE IMAGE EXACTLY — same colors, same graphics, same text, same everything
• ALL text must be LEGIBLE and SPELLED EXACTLY as shown in reference
• Do NOT add any elements not in reference
• Do NOT remove any elements from reference
• Do NOT change colors, patterns, or placement
• Pouch must appear THIN and FLEXIBLE — not inflated like a balloon
• This is the reference design at a front-facing angle, nothing more

ANTI-AI ARTIFACTS:
• NO warped or illegible text
• NO gibberish characters  
• NO modified graphics or colors
• NO inflated pouch shape
• NO invented design elements

## PROMPT 2: 3/4 LEFT VIEW

```
Professional commercial product photography.

REFERENCE IMAGE (CRITICAL — NON-NEGOTIABLE):
Use the uploaded product image as the EXACT and ONLY reference. Copy ALL design elements precisely:
• Exact colors
• Exact graphics and splatter patterns
• Exact text and typography
• Exact logo placement
Do NOT interpret, modify, or reimagine the design. The product design is LOCKED to the reference.

PRODUCT FORM:
Flexible stand-up gusseted supplement pouch. THIN and FLAT flexible packaging — NOT inflated, NOT puffy. Natural soft creases of real flexible pouch. When viewed from this angle, the thin side profile (approximately 1.5-2 inches deep) is visible.

ANGLE:
Three-quarter left view. Product rotated 35° to camera's left. Shows front face at angle AND left side panel simultaneously. This angle reveals the thin, flexible depth of the pouch. Product standing upright. Camera at eye-level.

BACKGROUND:
Pure white (#FFFFFF) seamless infinity backdrop.

LIGHTING:
Soft diffused key light from upper left. Fill from right. Rim light creating edge definition on side panel. Soft shadow beneath product.

CRITICAL — NON-NEGOTIABLE:
• Design must MATCH REFERENCE IMAGE EXACTLY
• Front face graphics visible at angle (naturally foreshortened by perspective)
• Left side shows design wrapping around naturally (colors continuing from front)
• ALL visible text must be LEGIBLE and match reference spelling
• Pouch must appear THIN — side profile shows slim flexible packaging, not inflated
• Do NOT invent new graphics for the side panel — show realistic wrap-around of front design

ANTI-AI ARTIFACTS:
• NO warped text
• NO invented side graphics
• NO inflated balloon shape
• NO modified colors or design

• Exact logo placement
Do NOT interpret, modify, or reimagine the design. The product design is LOCKED to the reference.

PRODUCT FORM:

ANGLE:
Flat lay / overhead view. Camera positioned directly above, shooting straight down at product. Product laying flat on white surface. Pouch rotated approximately 15° from vertical for visual interest. Full front face visible from above.

BACKGROUND/SURFACE:
Pure white surface OR white marble. Product casts soft natural shadow where edges contact surface.

LIGHTING:
Large overhead softbox for even diffused illumination. Subtle fill from sides. Soft shadow beneath pouch edges indicating physical contact with surface.

CRITICAL — NON-NEGOTIABLE:
• Design must MATCH REFERENCE IMAGE EXACTLY
• ALL text must be LEGIBLE and match reference spelling — viewed from directly above
• Full front design visible in this angle
• Pouch must appear as FLEXIBLE MATERIAL laying naturally — slight creases, organic settling
• NOT rigid like a book or box
• Do NOT modify any design elements

ANTI-AI ARTIFACTS:
• NO warped or illegible text
• NO modified graphics or colors
• NO rigid cardboard appearance
• NO invented elements

## USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

1. **Upload the PQ7 reference image** to Nano Banana FIRST
2. Set aspect ratio to 1:1
3. Paste prompt
4. Generate
5. Check output matches reference design exactly
6. Re-generate if AI has modified colors, text, or graphics

**Key principle:** The AI should treat the reference as a LOCKED design file. It can only change the camera angle and lighting — NOT the product design itself.
