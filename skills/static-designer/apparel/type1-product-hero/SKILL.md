## Headline Bank by Angle Type

### BIFL / Durability Angle
```
YOUR CAST IRON LASTS FOREVER. YOUR SHIRT SHOULD TOO.
OUTLASTS 10 ORDINARY SHIRTS.
THEY DON'T MAKE 'EM LIKE THEY USED TO. WE DO.
THE AVERAGE MAN SPENDS $180/YEAR REPLACING SHIRTS. THIS ONE LASTS 30 YEARS.
BUILT LIKE YOUR GRANDPA'S TOOLS. FITS LIKE YOUR FAVORITE TEE.
```

### Health/Toxicity Angle
```
POLYESTER IS LINKED TO LOW TESTOSTERONE. WE DON'T USE IT.
YOUR SHIRT IS LEACHING MICROPLASTICS INTO YOUR BLOODSTREAM. THIS ONE ISN'T.
PFAS. MICROPLASTICS. ENDOCRINE DISRUPTORS. OR JUST... HEMP AND BAMBOO.
51% HEMP. 31% BAMBOO. 18% ORGANIC COTTON. 0% POISON.
```

### Fast Fashion Rebellion Angle
```
FAST FASHION IS KILLING THE PLANET. THIS SHIRT LASTS 30 YEARS.
STOP FUNDING DISPOSABLE GARBAGE. BUY ONCE. WEAR FOR LIFE.
ONE SHIRT THAT OUTLASTS YOUR ENTIRE FAST FASHION WARDROBE.
H&M WANTS YOU BACK EVERY 6 MONTHS. WE DON'T.
THE LAST BLACK TEE YOU'LL EVER NEED TO BUY.
```

### Fed-Up Frustration Angle
```
STOP BUYING SHIRTS THAT FALL APART.
SICK OF SHIRTS THAT SHRINK, STINK, AND STRETCH OUT? SAME. SO WE FIXED IT.
IF YOUR SHIRTS LOOK LIKE CRAP AFTER 3 WASHES, IT'S NOT YOU. IT'S THE SHIRT.
EVERY SHIRT YOU'VE EVER LOVED HAS LET YOU DOWN. THIS ONE WON'T.
NO SAG. NO STRETCH. NO SHRINK. NO STINK. AFTER 100+ WASHES.
```

### Fit/Vanity Angle
```
GRIPS YOUR ARMS. HIDES YOUR GUT. LOOKS LIKE YOU LIFT.
THIS TEE DOES MORE FOR YOUR CONFIDENCE THAN YOUR PROTEIN POWDER.
TIGHT WHERE IT SHOULD BE. LOOSE WHERE IT MATTERS.
PUT IT ON. GET ASKED IF YOU LIFT. (EVEN IF YOU DON'T.)
```
