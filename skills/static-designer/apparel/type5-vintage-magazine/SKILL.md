# TYPE 5: VINTAGE MAGAZINE STYLE (APPAREL)

## Purpose
Generate nostalgic 1950s Americana magazine-style ads that evoke "things were better back then" emotions. This style only works for specific angles connected to heritage, craftsmanship, and anti-disposable culture messaging.

---

## When to Use This Style

**✅ USE FOR:**
- Heritage/craftsmanship angles ("built like they used to")
- Anti-fast-fashion / BIFL messaging
- Quality over quantity positioning
- Natural vs. synthetic (hemp vs. plastic)
- Generational/legacy messaging (heirloom, pass it down)
- Anti-corporate rebellion (planned obsolescence)

**❌ DON'T USE FOR:**
- Modern health/science angles (microplastics, PFAS, testosterone)
- Athletic performance / "look jacked" messaging
- Tech innovation angles (DuraFlow™, patent-pending)
- Price comparisons / rational value arguments
- Sensitive skin / medical angles
