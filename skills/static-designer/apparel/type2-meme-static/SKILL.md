# TYPE 2: MEME/CULTURAL STATIC (APPAREL)

## Purpose
Generate meme-format ads that leverage existing internet culture templates. Unlike Type 4 (illustrated educational), Type 2 uses **recognizable meme formats** for native, shareable content.

---

## When to Use

| Type 4 (Illustrated) | Type 2 (Meme) |
|---------------------|---------------|
| Educational/benefit-focused | Humor/irony-focused |
| Original illustrations | Recognizable meme templates |
| Direct angle testing | Cultural resonance testing |
| Explains why product is good | Assumes audience already gets it |

---

## Why Memes Work for Ads

1. **Pattern interrupt** - Doesn't look like an ad
2. **Social proof through humor** - "Other people like me buy this"
3. **Shareable** - Extends reach organically
4. **Low resistance** - They're laughing before they realize they're being sold
5. **Cultural belonging** - "This brand gets me"

## Meme Formats

### 1. GIGACHAD "Thank You For Changing My Life"

**How it works:**
- Top: Wojak (customer) being emotional/grateful
- Bottom: Gigachad (product) being humble about what it is
- Humor: Contrast between dramatic gratitude and mundane product description

**Layout:**
```
TOP LEFT: Wojak (grateful expression, happy tear, touched emotion)
TOP RIGHT: "Thank you for changing my life"

BOTTOM LEFT: Gigachad (side profile, beard, calm/unbothered)
BOTTOM RIGHT: Product image
BOTTOM TEXT: "I'm literally just a [humble product description]."

BOTTOM CENTER: CTA button
```

**Copy formula:**
"I'm literally just a [product] that [single benefit stated casually]."

**Examples:**
- "I'm literally just a shirt that won't leach microplastics into your bloodstream."
- "I'm literally just a shirt built like stuff used to be built."
- "I'm literally just a black t-shirt that doesn't fall apart."
- "I'm literally just a shirt that doesn't make your skin itch."

**Key:** Product is humble/unbothered. Benefit is stated as throwaway fact, not marketing speak.

---

### 2. DRAKE APPROVES/DISAPPROVES

**How it works:**
- Top: Drake rejecting bad option
- Bottom: Drake approving good option
- Simple A vs B comparison

**Layout:**
```
TOP PANEL:
Left: Drake disgusted (hand up) on yellow background
Right: White background with rejection text

BOTTOM PANEL:
Left: Drake approving (pointing) on yellow background  
Right: White background with product image + approval text

CTA button inside bottom white panel (not on separate bar)
```

**Copy formula:**
- Top: "[Bad thing they're currently doing]"
- Bottom: "[Good alternative - your product benefit]"

**Examples:**
- Top: "Wrapping your body in plastic every day" / Bottom: "Wearing actual plants"
- Top: "Buying a new shirt every 6 months" / Bottom: "Buying one shirt with a lifetime guarantee"
- Top: "Synthetic fibers linked to hormone disruption" / Bottom: "Natural fibers your skin actually likes"

**Key:** Keep both options short. Contrast must be obvious.

---

### 3. AVERAGE FAN VS AVERAGE ENJOYER

**How it works:**
- Left: Crying wojak = the inferior choice
- Right: Gigachad = the superior choice
- Elevates your product, mocks the alternative

**Layout:**
```
TOP LEFT: "Average [bad option] fan"
TOP RIGHT: "Average [good option] enjoyer"

LEFT: Crying wojak (distressed, tears)
RIGHT: Gigachad (confident, glowing)

BOTTOM CENTER: Product image
BOTTOM: CTA button
```

**Copy formula:**
- Left: "Average [competitor/bad material] fan"
- Right: "Average [your product/material] enjoyer"

**Examples:**
- "Average polyester fan" vs "Average hemp enjoyer"
- "Average 'buy cheap replace often' fan" vs "Average 'buy once cry once' enjoyer"
- "Average 'I don't read labels' fan" vs "Average 'I know what touches my skin' enjoyer"

**Key:** Ego-driven. Makes them want to be the chad, not the wojak.

## Copy Guidelines for Memes

### Keep it casual
Memes don't use marketing speak. Write like a person, not a brand.

**❌ Bad:** "Premium hemp fabric engineered for maximum comfort"
**✅ Good:** "I'm literally just a shirt that doesn't fall apart"

### One benefit only
Memes hit ONE point. Don't stack benefits.

**❌ Bad:** "...that's durable, breathable, antimicrobial, and eco-friendly"
**✅ Good:** "...that won't leach microplastics into your bloodstream"

### Use cultural references
Connect to things they already talk about.

**Examples:**
- "Built like stuff used to be built" (nostalgia/BIFL)
- "Wearing actual plants" (anti-plastic movement)
- "Won't leach microplastics" (health consciousness)

### CTA should fit the vibe
Don't break the meme energy with aggressive sales CTA.

**Good CTAs for memes:**
- "SHOP UNDRDOG"
- "MAKE THE SWITCH"
- "GET YOURS"
- "JOIN THE PACK"

## Reference Images

**For memes - NO reference needed.**

- Meme templates (Gigachad, Wojak, Drake) are recognizable formats AI already knows
- Product should look like basic PNG cutout, not styled photo
- Overproduced = defeats the purpose
- "Made in 5 minutes" energy is the goal

## Common Issues & Fixes

| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Wojak looks sad not grateful | AI defaults to crying wojak | Specify "grateful expression, happy tear, touched emotion" |
| Drake panels different colors | Inconsistent backgrounds | Specify "yellow on left, white on right, BOTH panels" |
| Black bar under meme | CTA placed outside format | Specify "CTA inside the white panel area, not on separate bar" |
| Product too polished | Reference image too styled | Don't use reference, let AI generate simple product |
| Copy sounds like marketing | Too many benefits/formal language | One benefit, casual language, "I'm literally just..." |
