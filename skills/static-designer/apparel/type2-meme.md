## COPY SKILL — TYPE 2 (MEME)

### Top Panel (Emotional Overreaction)
**Structure:** Sincere/dramatic appreciation that's deliberately over-the-top

**Examples:**
- "Thank you for changing my life"
- "You saved my marriage"
- "I can finally feel confident again"
- "My therapist said I don't need her anymore"
- "I haven't bought another shirt in 3 years"

**Rules:**
- Sounds like an emotional testimonial
- Deliberately exaggerated
- No quotation marks (it's dialogue)
- Earnest tone (the humor is in the contrast)

### Bottom Panel (Humble Product Response)
**Structure:** "I'm literally just a [product] [made from X] that you can [use cases] that's [benefit]."

**Formula:**
```
"I'm literally just a [PRODUCT TYPE]
made from [MATERIAL/KEY INGREDIENT] that you can
[USE CASE 1], [USE CASE 2], [USE CASE 3]
that's [KEY BENEFIT]."
```

**Examples:**
- "I'm literally just a shirt made from HEMP that you can wear to the gym, work, date night that's odor resistant."
- "I'm literally just a hoodie made from organic cotton that you can wear in summer, winter, travel that's temperature regulating."

**Rules:**
- Start with "I'm literally just a..."
- List 3 use cases
- End with ONE key benefit
- Casual, almost apologetic tone
- The humor comes from understating incredible features
