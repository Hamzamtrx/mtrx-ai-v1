```
Commercial product advertisement photo for health supplement brand.

REFERENCE IMAGE:
Use the 3x3 product grid. SELECT THE FRONT HERO ANGLE (top-left).
CLONE the [PRODUCT] design EXACTLY.

SCENE: Two female friends. One PRESENTING product, one LISTENING/REACTING.

MODELS:
WOMAN A (LEFT — The Presenter): Mid-30s, dark hair, [skin tone]. Cream cardigan.
WOMAN B (RIGHT — The Reactor): Mid-30s, light brown hair, fair skin. Camel sweater.
Different enough to be distinct, similar enough to be friends.

CRITICALLY DIFFERENT ROLES:
Woman A is SHOWING the product — she's the expert, the recommender.
Woman B is LEARNING about it — curious, impressed, asking questions.
They are NOT doing the same thing. NOT the same expression. NOT mirrored.

POSITIONING:
Woman A: Body angled toward camera (not toward Woman B). Holding product UP toward camera so product faces viewer. Looking at Woman B OR at camera with confident smile.
Woman B: Body angled toward Woman A. Leaning in slightly. Looking at the PRODUCT (not at Woman A's face). Interested expression.

EXPRESSIONS — DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER:
Woman A: Confident, proud, slight knowing smile. "Let me tell you about this."
Woman B: Curious, impressed, eyebrows raised. "Oh wow, really?"
NOT both laughing. NOT identical expressions. NOT synchronized.

HANDS — EXACTLY 4 HANDS TOTAL (2 per person):
Woman A: RIGHT hand holding product up, LEFT hand at side or gesturing slightly.
Woman B: Both hands relaxed — one at side, one touching her own arm. NOT hand on chest stock pose.
No extra hands. No floating hands.

PRODUCT PLACEMENT — CRITICAL:
Product held by Woman A, angled TOWARD CAMERA so design visible.
Product is focal point between them.
This is a product ad — product needs to be shown deliberately.

LIGHTING — DIRECTIONAL:
Key light from upper left.
Shadows on right side of both faces.
NOT flat.

SKIN/HAIR REALISM:
Real skin texture on both — pores, natural variation.
Different skin tones between them.
Natural hair with flyaways.
NOT airbrushed.

BACKGROUND:
Warm beige studio backdrop.

FRAMING:
Both waist-up.
Woman A takes 45%, Woman B takes 35%, product prominent.
Asymmetric composition.

NOT: Identical expressions, both laughing, mirrored poses, hand on chest, synchronized movements, product hidden between them, both looking at each other only, stock photo energy, flat lighting, extra hands.
