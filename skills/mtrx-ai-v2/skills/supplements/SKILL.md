## Avatar Framework

Identify which avatar the ad targets. Each avatar has specific language and objections.

|--------|--------------|--------------|
| **Skeptic** | Been burned before | "No proprietary blends", "full transparency", "research-backed" |
| **Food Noise Sufferer** | Can't stop thinking about food | "The radio won't turn off", "constant food thoughts", "mental quiet" |
| **3PM Crash** | Afternoon energy/craving crash | "Hit a wall", "afternoon slump", "blood sugar crash" |
| **Ozempic-Curious** | Wants GLP-1 results without needles/cost | "Same pathways", "no needles", "no prescription" |
| **Emotional Eater** | Eats when not hungry | "Standing at the pantry", "not actually hungry", "stress eating" |
| **Perimenopause Gainer** | Body changed in 40s | "What used to work doesn't work", "everything changed" |
| **Diet Veteran** | Tried everything, knows what to eat | "You don't need another diet", "the wanting, not the eating" |

## Language Guidelines

### USE:
- "Food noise" / "food chatter" (not "cravings")
- "The radio that won't turn off"
- "3pm crash" / "afternoon slump"
- "What used to work doesn't work anymore"
- "Peace of mind" / "mental quiet"
- Specific ingredients by name
- Specific timeframes ("within 2 weeks")

### AVOID:
- "Cravings" (too generic)
- "Appetite suppressant" (sounds like drug)
- "Burn fat" / "melt pounds" (scam language)
- "Revolutionary" / "breakthrough" (skeptics hate)
- "Game changer" / "life changing" (overused)
- "Proprietary blend" (red flag)
- Vague claims without specifics
