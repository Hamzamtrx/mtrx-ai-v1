## THE KEY CONCEPT: "FOOD NOISE"

This is THE term women are using. Not "cravings." Not "appetite." **Food noise.**

### How They Describe It:

> "It ruled my whole day every single day. As soon as I woke up I thought, 'what am I eating?' I just don't think about food anymore." — Casey Mason

> "It was like a sense of freedom from that loop of, 'What am I going to eat? I'm never full; there's not enough.'" — Wendy Gantt, 56

> "I didn't choose it to be there, but it was there all the time." — Sophia Pena, 32

> "I explain it as a radio being on in the background."

> "In my head, I thought it meant I was just weak; I was gluttonous. I'd wonder what's wrong with me."

> "I might not even need food immediately, but it's always there... it's like background noise."

> "The noise in your head stops. It is just so unbelievable." — Nancy Barnes

> "I had to think about the calories or what I'm going to eat. Is it healthy enough, not healthy enough? Am I going to need to justify that meal later?"

## AVATAR 3: THE EMOTIONAL EATER

### Who She Is:
- Knows she's not hungry but eats anyway
- Stress/boredom/anxiety eating
- Has tried willpower - it doesn't work
- Often eats "before she realizes what she's doing"
- Shame spiral after eating

### Her Exact Words:

**On the behavior:**
- "I'm not even hungry but I keep eating"
- "I'm standing in front of the pantry like a zombie"
- "I don't even know how I got there"
- "I eat the thing and think everything will be better. But it never actually is."
- "Before you know it, you've eaten a whole bag of chips without really paying attention"
- "Emotional hunger isn't satisfied once you're full. You keep wanting more and more."

**On the shame cycle:**
- "Unhappy emotions trigger you to overeat; you feel shame for overeating; shame makes you feel unhappy; because you are unhappy, you overeat again."
- "I have no self-control when it comes to eating"
- "Any time I'm upset, nervous, anxious or even happy, I turn to food"

**On willpower:**
- "27% of women say they nibble even if they're not feeling particularly hungry"
- "33% say they turn to unhealthier options when they are bored"
- "It's not about being strong enough to resist cravings"
- "Relying on willpower alone will leave you feeling like a failure"

### Her Triggers:
- Stress (cortisol → cravings for sugary/fatty foods)
- Boredom ("When there's not much else going on, food seems easy")
- Emotions ("trying to smother an emotion with food")
- Habits from childhood ("If your mom baked you cookies when something went wrong")

### Copy Angle for Her:
**Hook:** "You're not eating because you're hungry. You're eating because your brain won't shut up."
**Frame:** Saffron boosts serotonin - the satisfaction signal your brain is missing. That's why willpower doesn't work.

- "That sugar high is followed by an equally dramatic crash, leaving you feeling even more exhausted"

**On afternoon specifically:**
