# SKILL: Static Ad Research

## When To Use

Run this skill FIRST before any copy or image generation. Required input for all static ad types.

## Purpose

Extract everything needed to create on-brand, high-converting static ads:

1. **Brand Visual Identity** — Colors, fonts, logo, vibe
2. **Product Information** — What it is, what's in it, key claims
3. **Angle Research** — Product, cultural, and values layers
4. **Avatars** — Who we're talking to and how aware they are

**Output:** A complete research brief that feeds into copy and image generation.

## STEP 1: Brand Visual Identity

Analyze the brand's website to extract visual identity.

### What to Look For:

**Colors:**
- Primary background color (usually dark or light)
- Primary text color
- Accent color (buttons, highlights, checkmarks)
- Secondary accent if applicable

**Typography:**
- Headline font style (NOT the exact font — describe it)
  - Serif vs sans-serif
  - Weight (light, regular, bold, black, condensed)
  - Style (italic, ALL CAPS, sentence case)
- Body text style
- Overall typography vibe (premium, playful, aggressive, clean)

**Logo:**
- Style (wordmark, icon, script, etc.)
- Color treatment (white on dark, dark on light, colored)
- Placement convention (top center, top left, etc.)

**Overall Vibe:**
- One-line description of the brand's visual energy
- Reference brands or styles if helpful

### Output Format:

```
BRAND VISUAL IDENTITY

Brand: [Name]
Website: [URL]

COLORS:
- Background: [description + hex if visible]
- Primary text: [color]
- Accent: [color + hex if visible]
- Secondary: [if applicable]

TYPOGRAPHY:
- Headlines: [description — e.g., "Bold condensed sans-serif, ALL CAPS, white"]
- Body: [description]
- Vibe: [e.g., "Masculine, premium, high-contrast"]

LOGO:
- Style: [e.g., "Hand-drawn script wordmark"]
- Color: [e.g., "White on dark backgrounds"]
- Placement: [e.g., "Top center"]

OVERALL VIBE:
[One sentence — e.g., "Premium masculine workwear energy — think Carhartt meets Apple"]

REFERENCE FOR AI PROMPTS:
- Font instruction: [e.g., "Bold condensed sans-serif like Impact or Bebas Neue, ALL CAPS, white"]
- Color instruction: [e.g., "Dark charcoal gradient background, orange (#FF6B35) accent"]
- Logo instruction: [e.g., "White hand-drawn script logo top center"]
```

## STEP 2: Product Information

Extract core product details from website.

### What to Look For:

**Basic Info:**
- Product name
- Price (and price anchoring — bundles, discounts)
- Guarantee/return policy
- Shipping info if relevant

**Composition:**
- What's it made of? (ingredients, materials)
- Key percentages or specs
- What's NOT in it (often as important)

**Key Claims:**
- Primary benefit claim
- Supporting claims
- Any specific numbers (4x stronger, 30 years, etc.)
- Test results or proof points

**Founder Story (if present):**
- Why they made it
- Personal connection to problem
- Credibility builders

### Output Format:

```
PRODUCT INFORMATION

Product: [Name]
Brand: [Brand]
Price: [Price + any bundle pricing]
Guarantee: [Details]

COMPOSITION:
- [Material/ingredient 1]: [percentage if known] — [what it does]
- [Material/ingredient 2]: [percentage if known] — [what it does]
- NOT included: [what's excluded and why it matters]

KEY CLAIMS:
- Primary: [Main benefit claim]
- Supporting: 
  - [Claim 2]
  - [Claim 3]
  - [Claim 4]
- Proof points: [Any tests, numbers, certifications]

FOUNDER STORY:
[Brief summary if present — this often contains emotional hooks]

UNIQUE MECHANISM:
[What makes this work differently? Name if branded — e.g., "DuraFlow™"]
```

## STEP 3: Angle Research (Three Layers)

This is where the real work happens. Go beyond product features.

### Layer 1: Product Research

How do people talk about this product category?

**Search for:**
- Reddit discussions about the category
- Amazon reviews of competitors
- TikTok/YouTube comments
- Forum complaints and praise

**Look for:**
- Exact phrases they use
- Specific frustrations (not generic)
- What they've tried that failed
- What surprised them when something worked

**Output:**
```
PRODUCT LAYER

Category frustrations (exact language):
- "[Exact quote 1]"
- "[Exact quote 2]"
- "[Exact quote 3]"

What they've tried that failed:
- [Solution 1] — why it failed
- [Solution 2] — why it failed

What surprises/delights them:
- [Unexpected benefit 1]
- [Unexpected benefit 2]

Language patterns:
- They say: "[phrase]" not "[marketer phrase]"
- They say: "[phrase]" not "[marketer phrase]"
```

### Layer 2: Cultural Research

What broader cultural frustration does this tap into?

**Ask:**
- What does this product/problem REPRESENT?
- What do they believe about modern culture?
- What do they feel is LOST?
- What tribe do they belong to?

**Output:**
```
CULTURAL LAYER

What this represents beyond the product:
[Description]

Cultural beliefs this taps into:
- "[Belief 1]"
- "[Belief 2]"
- "[Belief 3]"

What they feel is lost:
- [Loss 1]
- [Loss 2]

Cultural references that resonate:
- [Reference 1 — e.g., "grandpa's tools"]
- [Reference 2 — e.g., "cast iron skillets"]

Cultural tribe:
[Description — e.g., "Buy It For Life movement, anti-consumption"]
```

### Layer 3: Values/Political Research

Go deepest. What worldview does this validate?

**Ask:**
- What values drive them?
- What are they rebelling against?
- What would buying this PROVE?
- How do they see the world?

**Output:**
```
VALUES LAYER

Core values:
- [Value 1 — e.g., "Integrity"]
- [Value 2 — e.g., "Craftsmanship"]
- [Value 3 — e.g., "Self-reliance"]

What they're rebelling against:
- [Enemy 1 — e.g., "Disposable culture"]
- [Enemy 2 — e.g., "Corporations that don't care"]

What buying this PROVES:
- [Proof 1 — e.g., "Quality still exists somewhere"]
- [Proof 2 — e.g., "Someone still gives a damn"]

Worldview in one sentence:
[e.g., "Things used to be better, and they can be again if someone cares enough to do it right."]
```

---

## STEP 4: Avatar Development

Split audience into distinct avatars based on research.

### For Each Avatar:

```
AVATAR: [Descriptive Name]

WHO THEY ARE:
- Demographics: [Age, gender, location if relevant]
- Lifestyle: [Job, interests, identity]
- Values: [What matters to them]

WHAT THEY ALREADY BELIEVE:
- About the category: [Belief]
- About the world: [Belief]

AWARENESS LEVEL OF THIS ANGLE:
[High / Medium / Low]
- High = Lead with angle directly
- Medium = Explain the mechanism
- Low = Lead with benefit they want, angle is the explanation

LANGUAGE THEY USE:
- "[Phrase 1]"
- "[Phrase 2]"
- "[Phrase 3]"

WHAT THIS PRODUCT REPRESENTS TO THEM:
[Beyond function — what does buying it mean?]

HOOK STYLE THAT WORKS:
[Values-based? Problem-based? Aspiration-based?]
```

---

## STEP 5: Angle Opportunities

Based on all research, identify testable angles.

### Output Format:

```
ANGLE OPPORTUNITIES

ANGLE 1: [Name]
- Hook: [One-line description]
- Values layer connection: [What belief does this validate?]
- Headline direction: [Example headline concept]
- Avatar fit: [Which avatar(s)]
- Awareness level: [High/Medium/Low for this angle]

ANGLE 2: [Name]
- Hook:
- Values layer connection:
- Headline direction:
- Avatar fit:
- Awareness level:

[Continue for 3-5 angles]

ANGLES TO AVOID:
- [Angle] — why: [reason]
- [Angle] — why: [reason]
```
