## HEADLINE QUALITY CHECK

Before using any headline, verify:

- [ ] Works standalone (no context needed)
- [ ] Specific (not generic marketing speak)
- [ ] Visceral language (not corporate)
- [ ] Matches avatar's awareness level
- [ ] Doesn't require product name
- [ ] ALL CAPS ready for Nano Banana

### Red Flags (Rewrite These)
- "High-quality materials" → Too generic
- "The best shirt you'll ever own" → Unsubstantiated
- "Revolutionary fabric technology" → Corporate speak
- "You deserve better" → Empty flattery
- "Introducing..." → No one cares

### Green Flags (These Work)
- Specific numbers (30 years, 100+ washes)
- Familiar comparisons (cast iron, grandpa's tools)
- Direct frustration language (fall apart, shrink, stink)
- Unexpected claims (linked to low testosterone)
- Commands (Stop buying...)
