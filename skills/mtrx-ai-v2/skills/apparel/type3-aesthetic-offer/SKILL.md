# TYPE 3: AESTHETIC + OFFER (APPAREL)

## Purpose
Generate lifestyle/editorial static ads with text overlay. Unlike Type 1 (product on gradient), Type 3 places the product in a contextual environment that matches the target avatar and angle.

---

## Prerequisites

1. **Research Brief** - Must have completed research skill with:
   - Avatars defined
   - Aesthetic directions identified
   - Angles and headlines ready

2. **3x3 Product Grid** - Must generate product reference grid first:
   - Upload as reference for all aesthetic shots
   - Ensures product consistency across all images

---

## Workflow

```
RESEARCH → AVATAR → AESTHETIC DIRECTION → VISUAL COMPOSITION → ANGLE → HEADLINE → PROMPT
```

1. Select avatar from research
2. Match aesthetic direction to avatar
3. Choose visual composition type (see below)
4. Select angle that fits
5. Write headline (3-8 words for Type 3)
6. Build prompt

## Avatar → Composition Matching

| Avatar | Best Compositions | Aesthetic Directions |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Americana Nostalgic | Flat Lay, Closet | Workshop, Truck Bed, Cabin |
| Health-Conscious | On-Body, Flat Lay | Gym, Clean Dark |
| Fed-Up Replacer | Trash Can, Durability Demo | Neutral, Morning Routine |
| Minimalist | Closet, On-Body | Clean Dark, Scandinavian |

## Headline Guidelines

**Type 3 headlines are SHORT: 3-8 words**

They must:
- Work standalone (no context needed)
- Be specific (not generic marketing)
- Match avatar awareness level

**Type 1 → Type 3 compression:**
- "YOUR CAST IRON LASTS FOREVER. YOUR SHIRT SHOULD TOO." → "BUILT TO LAST 30 YEARS."
- "POLYESTER IS LINKED TO LOW TESTOSTERONE. WE DON'T USE IT." → "NO POLYESTER. NO POISON."
- "STOP BUYING SHIRTS THAT FALL APART." → (already short, keep as is)

| Shirt keeps folding | AI interprets "casual" as folded | Use 3x3 grid reference, specify exact frame |
| Wrong logo/tab | AI hallucinates details | Provide close-up reference images |
| Text overlaps product | Composition not specified | Add "TEXT OVERLAID ON IMAGE" section, specify text zone |
| Headline errors | Too many words/punctuation | Keep under 8 words, avoid mid-sentence periods |
