# TYPE 4: ILLUSTRATED/ANIMATED STATIC (APPAREL)

## Purpose
Generate illustrated/cartoon style ads for **angle testing**. Unlike Type 3 (photography for proven angles), Type 4 is for rapidly testing new angles with benefit-focused, educational content.

---

## When to Use

| Type 3 (Photography) | Type 4 (Illustrated) |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| Proven angles | Testing new angles |
| Emotional storytelling | Educational/benefit-focused |
| Lifestyle context | Direct comparisons |
| Premium feel | Playful/meme energy |
| 3x3 grid required | Single reference (loose) |

## Research Requirements

**Before writing copy, you MUST research:**

1. **Reddit/Forums** - How do people actually talk about this problem?
2. **Failed solutions** - What have they tried that didn't work?
3. **Emotional state** - Frustrated? Skeptical? Desperate?
4. **Language patterns** - Exact phrases they use
5. **Cultural layer** - What movement/trend does this connect to?
6. **Values layer** - What does buying this prove about them?

**Research template:**
```

REDDIT RESEARCH:
- Common complaints: [quotes/paraphrases]

```

## Copy Structure

**Every Type 4 ad has three parts that must flow together:**

```
HEADLINE → BENEFITS → CTA
(Problem/Claim) → (Proof/Solution) → (Action)
```

**The flow test:** Read headline, then benefits, then CTA out loud. Does it sound like one continuous argument? If not, revise.

---

## Copy Guidelines

### Headlines (Problem or Claim)

**Good headlines:**
- State a problem they recognize
- Make a direct comparison
- Challenge what they believe
- Call out a specific audience

**Examples:**
- "YOUR SHIRT IS GIVING YOU A RASH." (problem)
- "HEMP > POLYESTER." (comparison)
- "HYPOALLERGENIC IS A LIE." (challenge)
- "ECZEMA? YOUR SHIRT ISN'T HELPING." (callout)

**Bad headlines:**
- Generic marketing speak
- Benefits without setup
- Too clever/indirect

---

### Benefits (Proof that supports headline)

**Rules:**
- Must directly support the headline claim
- 3 benefits maximum
- Short phrases (2-5 words each)
- Parallel structure when possible

**If headline is a PROBLEM → Benefits show how you solve it**
```
Headline: "YOUR SHIRT IS GIVING YOU A RASH."
Benefits:
- Zero synthetic fibers
- Zero chemical treatments  
- Zero skin irritation
```

**If headline is a COMPARISON → Benefits prove why one is better**
```
Headline: "HEMP > POLYESTER."
Benefits:
- 3x stronger
- Zero microplastics
- Gets softer not worse
```

**If headline is a CHALLENGE → Benefits reveal the truth**
```
Headline: "HYPOALLERGENIC IS A LIE."
Benefits:
- No synthetic "hypoallergenic" BS
- Just natural fibers that don't irritate
- Hemp, bamboo, organic cotton
```

---

### CTA (Action that completes the argument)

**Rules:**
- Must feel like natural next step after benefits
- Action-oriented verb
- 2-4 words

**CTA patterns:**

| Headline Type | CTA Style | Examples |
|---------------|-----------|----------|
| Problem | End the problem | "END THE ITCH", "STOP THE RASH" |
| Comparison | Make the switch | "MAKE THE SWITCH", "UPGRADE NOW" |
| Challenge | Try the alternative | "TRY ACTUALLY NATURAL", "SEE FOR YOURSELF" |
| Callout | Get relief | "FINALLY, RELIEF", "YOUR SKIN WILL THANK YOU" |

---

## Flow Examples

### ✅ GOOD FLOW:

**Headline:** "ECZEMA? YOUR SHIRT ISN'T HELPING."
**Benefits:**
- Zero synthetic irritants
- Breathable natural fibers
- Dermatologist-recommended materials
**CTA:** "FINALLY, RELIEF"

*Flow: You have eczema → your shirt makes it worse → here's what helps → get relief*

---

### ✅ GOOD FLOW:

**Headline:** "YOU READ FOOD LABELS. READ YOUR SHIRT LABEL."
**Benefits:**
- 51% Hemp, 31% Bamboo, 18% Organic Cotton
- 0% Polyester, 0% Plastic, 0% Chemicals
- Clean enough to sleep in
**CTA:** "WEAR CLEAN"

*Flow: You care what goes in your body → care what goes on it → here's what's in ours → wear clean*

---

### ❌ BAD FLOW:

**Headline:** "HEMP > POLYESTER."
**Benefits:**
- Lifetime guarantee
- Free shipping
- 30-day returns
**CTA:** "SHOP NOW"

*Why it fails: Benefits don't prove why hemp is better than polyester. They're generic offers, not proof points.*

## Visual Composition Types

### 1. FLOATING PRODUCT (Awe/Discovery)
Product floats center with glow/sparkles. Characters on sides looking up in amazement.

**Best for:** Material superiority, product introduction
**Energy:** "Behold, the solution"

---

### 2. SPLIT COMPARISON (Before/After)
Two panels side by side. Left = problem state. Right = solution state.

**Best for:** Transformation, relief, contrast
**Energy:** "This vs. That"

---

### 3. ACTION DEMO (Proof)
Product being tested - stretched, pulled, stressed. Shows durability/quality.

**Best for:** Durability claims, strength proof
**Energy:** "Watch this"

---

### 4. CALLOUT/WARNING (Problem Awareness)
Warning symbols, red flags, danger imagery around the problem. Solution shown as safe alternative.

**Best for:** Health scares, hidden dangers
**Energy:** "Did you know?"

---

## Prompt Template

```
Illustrated advertisement in cartoon/comic style. Static ad.

PRODUCT REFERENCE:
Use uploaded image as loose reference for the shirt design. Cartoon/illustrated interpretation, not photorealistic.

STYLE:
2D cartoon illustration. Bold outlines. Flat colors. [Energy description - e.g., "empathetic but hopeful" / "confident and challenging" / "informative and clear"].

SCENE:
[Visual composition description - what's happening, who's in it, what's the contrast]

TEXT LAYOUT:

```

## Reference Image

**For Type 4, use ONE product image as loose reference.**

Unlike Type 3 (which needs 3x3 grid for photorealism), Type 4 only needs a general sense of the product shape/style.

Add this line to prompts:
```
PRODUCT REFERENCE:
Use uploaded image as loose reference for the shirt design. Cartoon/illustrated interpretation, not photorealistic.
```

## Angle Testing Workflow

1. **Identify angle** from product claims or market gaps
2. **Deep research** - Reddit, forums, cultural context
3. **Write copy** using Headline → Benefits → CTA flow
4. **Check flow** - read aloud, does it sound like one argument?
5. **Select visual composition** that matches the angle energy
6. **Generate prompt** using template
7. **Test in Higgsfield/Nano Banana**
8. **Evaluate** - does the visual support the copy?

## Status: VALIDATED ✅

**Test Date:** January 30, 2026
**Platform:** Higgsfield
