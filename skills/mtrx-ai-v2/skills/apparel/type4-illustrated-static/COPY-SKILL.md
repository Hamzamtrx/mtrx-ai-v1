# TYPE 4 COPY SKILL: ANGLE TESTING

## Purpose
Write copy for illustrated/animated static ads that **tests new angles**. Every angle needs research before copy.

---

## The Rule: Research Before Copy

**Never write Type 4 copy without completing research first.**

Bad process: Come up with headline → make up benefits → generic CTA
Good process: Research problem → understand audience language → write copy that flows

---

## Research Template

Complete this for EVERY new angle:

```
## ANGLE: [Name]

### PROBLEM RESEARCH

**What's the core problem?**
[One sentence]

**Reddit/Forum language:**
- "[Exact quote or paraphrase]"
- "[Exact quote or paraphrase]"
- "[Exact quote or paraphrase]"

**Failed solutions they've tried:**
- [Solution 1]
- [Solution 2]
- [Solution 3]

**Emotional state:**
[Frustrated / Skeptical / Desperate / Confused / Angry]

### CULTURAL LAYER

**Connected to what movement/trend?**
[Clean beauty / Health optimization / Anti-fast fashion / etc.]

**Crossover audiences:**
[Who else cares about this problem?]

### VALUES LAYER

**Core belief:**
"[What they believe about the world]"

**Rebelling against:**
[What system/lie/status quo are they rejecting?]

**What buying proves:**
"[Identity statement - I am someone who...]"

### COPY DIRECTION

**Headline approach:**
[Problem callout / Direct comparison / Challenge belief / Audience callout]

**Proof points needed:**
[What evidence supports the headline?]

**Emotional resolution:**
[What do they want to feel after? Relief / Vindication / Confidence]
```

## Copy Formula

### Step 1: Headline (The Hook)

**Four headline types:**

| Type | Formula | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Problem Callout | "YOUR [THING] IS [BAD THING]." | "YOUR SHIRT IS GIVING YOU A RASH." |
| Direct Comparison | "[A] > [B]." | "HEMP > POLYESTER." |
| Challenge Belief | "[COMMON BELIEF] IS A LIE." | "HYPOALLERGENIC IS A LIE." |
| Audience Callout | "[CONDITION]? YOUR [THING] ISN'T HELPING." | "ECZEMA? YOUR SHIRT ISN'T HELPING." |

**Headline rules:**
- 3-8 words ideal
- Must be specific, not generic
- Should trigger recognition ("that's me")

---

### Step 2: Benefits (The Proof)

**Benefits must answer: "Why should I believe the headline?"**

| If headline says... | Benefits should... |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| There's a problem | Show how you solve it |
| A > B | Prove why A is better |
| X is a lie | Reveal the truth |
| Your thing isn't helping | Show what actually helps |

**Benefit rules:**
- 3 benefits maximum
- 2-5 words each
- Parallel structure (all start same way, or all same length)
- Must directly support headline - no random features

**Parallel structure examples:**

✅ Good:
- Zero synthetic irritants
- Zero chemical treatments
- Zero skin irritation

✅ Good:
- 3x stronger
- Zero microplastics
- Gets softer not worse

❌ Bad (not parallel, random):
- Made with hemp
- Free shipping
- Lifetime guarantee

---

### Step 3: CTA (The Resolution)

**CTA must feel like the natural next step after reading benefits.**

**Test:** Read headline → benefits → CTA out loud. Does CTA feel like the obvious conclusion?

| Headline Energy | CTA Energy | Examples |
|-----------------|------------|----------|
| Problem/Pain | End the pain | "END THE ITCH", "STOP THE CYCLE" |
| Comparison | Make the change | "MAKE THE SWITCH", "UPGRADE NOW" |
| Challenge/Truth | Try the real thing | "TRY ACTUALLY NATURAL", "SEE THE TRUTH" |
| Audience callout | Get relief | "FINALLY, RELIEF", "YOUR SKIN WILL THANK YOU" |

**CTA rules:**
- 2-4 words
- Action verb required
- Must connect to headline promise

---

## Flow Check

Before finalizing, read the full copy as one statement:

**Template:**
"[HEADLINE] because [BENEFIT 1], [BENEFIT 2], [BENEFIT 3]. So [CTA]."

**Example:**
"Your shirt is giving you a rash because it has synthetic fibers, chemical treatments, and skin irritants. So end the itch."

Does it flow? Does each part connect? If not, revise.

---

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Benefits don't support headline
**Headline:** "HEMP > POLYESTER."
**Benefits:** Lifetime guarantee, Free shipping, 30-day returns
**Problem:** Benefits are generic offers, not proof of why hemp beats polyester

**Fix:**
**Benefits:** 3x stronger, Zero microplastics, Gets softer not worse

---

### ❌ CTA doesn't resolve the headline
**Headline:** "YOUR SHIRT IS GIVING YOU A RASH."
**CTA:** "SHOP NOW"
**Problem:** Generic CTA doesn't connect to the specific problem

**Fix:**
**CTA:** "END THE ITCH"

---

### ❌ No research = generic copy
**Headline:** "BETTER SHIRTS FOR BETTER SKIN."
**Problem:** Vague, could be any brand, doesn't trigger recognition

**Fix:** Research how people actually talk about the problem, use their language
**Better headline:** "ECZEMA? YOUR SHIRT ISN'T HELPING."
