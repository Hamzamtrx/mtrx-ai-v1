## TROUBLESHOOTING

**If Nano Banana generates single image instead of grid:**
- Add "2x2 composite image" or "4-panel grid layout" to start of prompt
- Try "Split into 4 equal quadrants"

**If product is too thick/puffy:**
- Emphasize "THIN", "FLAT", "FLEXIBLE", "NOT inflated"
- Add "slim profile" to angle descriptions

**If text is garbled:**
- Reduce amount of text specified
- Focus on key branding only (logo, product name)
- Add "text must be sharp and readable"

**If colors are wrong:**
- Include HEX codes
- Describe color placement specifically
