## ANGLE 1: FRONT HERO

```
Professional commercial product photography. Primal Queen PQ7 dietary supplement pouch. Front hero shot.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION (CRITICAL — NON-NEGOTIABLE):
Stand-up gusseted flexible pouch. Tapered rectangular silhouette approximately 7 inches tall by 5 inches wide at base, narrowing slightly toward top with squared shoulders and softly rounded bottom corners. Flat bottom gusset approximately 2 inches deep allows stable freestanding position. Top edge features horizontal heat-sealed closure with subtle tear notch. 

MATERIAL (CRITICAL — NON-NEGOTIABLE):
Metallized BOPP/PET laminate film. Matte finish with subtle metallic sheen visible in areas of lighter ink coverage. Surface displays natural soft creases and gentle folds inherent to flexible film packaging — this is a THIN, FLEXIBLE pouch, NOT inflated, NOT puffy, NOT rigid. The material should catch light softly with diffused reflections, no harsh specular highlights.

COLOR SPECIFICATIONS (ACTIVE — ACTIVE MEANS ACTIVE):
- Primary base: Deep teal-cyan (#1A5F6B) covering approximately 60% of front face
- Splatter 1: Hot pink/magenta (#E84C8A) — concentrated in upper right quadrant with vertical drip trails descending from top edge, organic irregular edges, satellite droplets
- Splatter 2: Lime green (#8BC34A) — cluster in upper left corner, secondary cluster in lower left corner near gusset
- Splatter 3: Bright yellow (#E8D44D) — bold diagonal splash across right side from mid-height downward, fine scattered droplets
- Splatter 4: Dark purple (#4A2C6A) — solid fill triangular section at bottom occupying approximately bottom 20% of pouch face
- All paint splatters exhibit organic spray patterns with varying opacity, feathered edges, and natural randomness

TYPOGRAPHY & BRANDING (ACTIVE — TEXT ACTIVE — ACTIVE):
Line 1: "PRIMAL" — top center, large bold graffiti-style brush script approximately 1.2 inches tall, white fill (#FFFFFF) with hot pink (#E84C8A) offset drop shadow creating 3D effect, letterforms have rough hand-painted irregular edges, baseline tilts approximately 5° upward from left to right
Line 2: "QUEEN" — directly below PRIMAL with 0.25 inch gap, clean geometric sans-serif, all uppercase, white (#FFFFFF), generous letter-spacing (tracking +50), perfectly horizontal baseline, approximately 0.4 inches tall
Line 3: "PQ7" — DOMINANT CENTRAL ELEMENT positioned mid-face, occupying approximately 40% of front surface area, white (#FFFFFF) chunky graffiti-style letterforms with hot pink (#E84C8A) dripping wet paint effect — drips hang from bottom edges of P, Q, and 7, the "7" features most prominent drip trails extending approximately 0.5 inches below character baseline
Line 4: Crown icon — simplified geometric crown symbol with 3 points, hot pink (#E84C8A) solid fill, approximately 0.6 inches wide, centered horizontally below PQ7
Line 5: "Mother Nature's Gift for Calming" (line break) "Cravings and Taming Appetite" — elegant flowing script font, warm gold (#D4A84B), two lines centered, positioned in lower third above purple section, approximately 0.3 inch cap height
Line 6: "60 Capsules | Dietary Supplement" — small clean sans-serif, warm gold (#D4A84B), single line at bottom center within or just above purple section, approximately 0.15 inch cap height

CAMERA & ANGLE:
Front facing, product face parallel to image plane. Product standing upright on reflective white surface. Camera positioned at product eye-level (approximately 3.5 inches from surface) with subtle 3° upward tilt to create slight heroic perspective. 85mm equivalent focal length. f/8 aperture for full product sharpness. Product centered in frame with 15% padding on all sides.

LIGHTING:
Soft diffused key light positioned upper left at 45° angle, large softbox or scrim creating gentle gradient across pouch face. Fill light from right at 25% key intensity preventing harsh shadows. Subtle rim/edge light from behind creating separation from background. No harsh shadows — soft diffused shadow beneath product grounding it to surface. Matte pouch surface produces soft scattered reflections, no specular hotspots.

BACKGROUND:
Pure white (#FFFFFF) seamless infinity sweep. No visible horizon line, no gradients, no texture. Clean commercial studio environment.

## ANGLE 4: FLAT LAY (OVERHEAD)

```
Professional commercial product photography. Primal Queen PQ7 dietary supplement pouch. Flat lay overhead view.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION (CRITICAL — NON-NEGOTIABLE):

Tapered rectangular shape approximately 7 inches tall by 5 inches wide. Top heat-sealed edge visible. Bottom gusset folds flat beneath the pouch.

MATERIAL (CRITICAL — NON-NEGOTIABLE):
Metallized BOPP/PET laminate film. Matte finish with subtle sheen. When laying flat, the pouch displays natural soft creases, gentle wrinkles, and the relaxed character of flexible film packaging. NOT rigid, NOT perfectly flat like cardboard — shows organic settling of flexible material. Surface catches overhead light with soft diffused reflection.

COLOR SPECIFICATIONS (ACTIVE — ACTIVE MEANS ACTIVE):
Full front face visible from above:
- Primary base: Deep teal-cyan (#1A5F6B) covering 60% of face
- Splatter 1: Hot pink/magenta (#E84C8A) upper right quadrant with drip trails

- "Mother Nature's Gift for Calming Cravings and Taming Appetite" — gold script, lower third
- "60 Capsules | Dietary Supplement" — small gold, bottom

CAMERA & ANGLE:
Camera positioned directly overhead, perpendicular to surface, shooting straight down at product. Product laying flat on white marble surface OR pure white surface. Pouch angled approximately 15° from vertical axis for visual interest (not perfectly aligned with frame edges). Full product visible with 20% padding around edges. 50mm equivalent. f/11 for full sharpness across flat plane.

LIGHTING:
Large overhead softbox creating even diffused illumination across entire product. Subtle fill from sides preventing any harsh shadows. Soft natural shadow beneath pouch edges where it contacts surface, indicating it has physical presence and weight. No harsh directional shadows crossing the product face.

BACKGROUND/SURFACE:
Option A: Pure white surface (#FFFFFF) with product casting subtle soft shadow
Option B: White/gray marble surface with subtle veining for premium feel
Clean, minimal, product is hero.

PRODUCT FIDELITY (CRITICAL — NON-NEGOTIABLE):
• Product EXACTLY as described — same pouch as other angles, now laying flat
• ALL text must be LEGIBLE, ACCURATELY SPELLED — no distortion from overhead view
• Colors must match specifications precisely
• Pouch must appear as FLEXIBLE MATERIAL laying naturally — slight creases, organic settling
• NOT rigid like a book cover — shows character of flexible film

ANTI-AI ARTIFACT COMPLIANCE (CRITICAL — NON-NEGOTIABLE):
