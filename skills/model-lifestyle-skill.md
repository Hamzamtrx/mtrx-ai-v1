## CRITICAL ELEMENTS

### 1. SETTING — REAL LIVED-IN SPACE

Elements that make it feel like a real home:
- Textured wall (subtle plaster, warm cream paint)
- Wooden shelf with books, candle, small plant
- Fresh flowers or greenery
- Soft curtains with texture
- Morning light creating patterns/shadows

This is someone's REAL home — not a photo studio.
Lived-in but tidy. Curated but natural.
```

```
Relaxed posture — NOT formal upright.
One leg up, one leg to side OR casual seated position.
