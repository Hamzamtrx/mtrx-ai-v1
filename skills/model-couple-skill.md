# MODEL COUPLE SKILL

**Status:** VALIDATED ✅  
**Last Updated:** January 29, 2026

Generate professional couple model shots — organic conversation, natural interaction.

---

## WHEN TO USE

- Family/relationship brand marketing
- Testimonial-style ads
- "Couples who use this together" angle
- Trust-building social proof

---

## KEY LEARNINGS

Multi-person shots have two challenges:
1. **Product fidelity** — AI simplifies product design when juggling 2 people
2. **Human realism** — Both people can look too "AI perfect"

Solutions built into templates below.

## TEMPLATE: COUPLE ORGANIC CONVERSATION

```
PRODUCT DESIGN — READ THIS 3 TIMES BEFORE GENERATING:

The product pouch has THIS EXACT DESIGN:
- Base color: [COLOR]
- TOP SECTION: [describe splatters, graphics, text]
- "BRAND NAME" in [color] at very top
- "[PRODUCT NAME]" in MASSIVE [color] letters with [outline color] in center
- [Icon description] below product name
- MIDDLE SECTION: [describe splatters, colors]
- BOTTOM SECTION: [COLOR] with [tagline text in color]
- "[Details text]" at very bottom

THIS IS NOT A CLEAN MINIMAL POUCH.
[Describe the visual complexity — busy, colorful, detailed, etc.]

REFERENCE THE GRID IMAGE. COPY IT EXACTLY.

---

Commercial product photo. Couple having conversation about product.

REFERENCE IMAGE:
Use the 3x3 product grid. SELECT THE 3/4 LEFT ANGLE (middle-left).
CLONE that EXACT design with ALL text and graphics.

MODELS:
Wife: Early 40s, dark hair, [skin tone], [outfit e.g., cream cardigan over white top].
Husband: Late 40s, silver/grey hair, stubble, [outfit e.g., beige polo shirt].
Real comfortable couple energy.

POSITIONING — DYNAMIC, NOT SQUARED:
Wife on LEFT, body angled 45° toward husband (NOT toward camera).
Husband on RIGHT, body angled toward wife, slightly BEHIND her.
He is TALLER so his head is higher in frame.
She is slightly FORWARD, he is slightly BACK.
NOT side-by-side lineup.

CAUGHT MID-CONVERSATION:
They are having a real moment — she's showing him the product.
Wife: Turned toward husband, holding product up between them, explaining something.
Husband: Leaning in slightly, looking AT THE PRODUCT in her hands with genuine interest.
Neither looking at camera — this is THEIR moment, we're just observing.

EXPRESSIONS — NATURAL INTERACTION:
Wife: Animated, mid-sentence, warm expression, eyebrows slightly raised — "and this is why it works."
Husband: Interested, attentive, slight smile, looking at product OR at her face — "oh really?"
NOT posed smiles. NOT looking at camera. NOT identical expressions.

HANDS — EXACTLY 4 HANDS TOTAL:
Wife: Both hands on product, holding it up to show him.
Husband: One hand relaxed at side, other hand perhaps touching her back or his own chin (thinking gesture).
No extra hands. No floating hands.

PRODUCT PLACEMENT — CRITICAL:
Product held BETWEEN them at chest height.
3/4 angle visible — shows depth and dimension.
Product is what they're both focused on.

PRODUCT FIDELITY — CRITICAL:
Product has [ALL DESIGN ELEMENTS].
NOT a plain solid color pouch.
ALL text must be visible.
The [specific design elements] MUST be visible.
MATCH THE REFERENCE GRID IMAGE.

HUMAN REALISM — CRITICAL (ANTI-AI):

SKIN — NOT PERFECT:
- Visible pores on nose, cheeks, forehead — like unedited iPhone photo
- Natural skin texture variation — NOT uniform smooth
- HIM: Visible stubble shadow, forehead lines, crow's feet, slight sun damage/age spots okay
- HER: Smile lines, subtle under-eye tone, natural flush variation
- Both look authentically mid-40s — NOT airbrushed to look 30
- Slight shine on nose/forehead from natural oil — NOT matte flat

HAIR — NOT HELMET:
- HIM: Natural grey with texture variation, some strands out of place, natural hairline with slight recession okay
- HER: Baby hairs at hairline, flyaways catching light, not every strand perfect
- Hair looks like it exists in real air — NOT CGI smooth

EYES:
- Subtle blood vessels in whites (barely visible)
- Natural asymmetry — eyes slightly different
- Real catchlights — NOT perfect circles

CLOTHING:
- Natural fabric wrinkles at elbows, shoulders
- NOT vacuum-sealed or painted on
- Real texture visible in knit/weave

---

LIGHTING — WARM DIRECTIONAL:
Key light from upper left.
Creates shadows — dimensional, not flat.
Warm golden tone.
Background gradient darker on right.

BACKGROUND:
Warm beige studio backdrop.
Soft gradient.

FRAMING:
Both from waist up.
ASYMMETRIC — she's slightly lower-left, he's slightly higher-right.
NOT centered. NOT symmetrical.
Diagonal composition.

CAMERA:
50mm. f/2.8. Slight angle — NOT dead straight on.

OVERALL FEEL:
We're observing a real couple's moment.
Candid documentary energy in a studio setting.
"Photographer caught them between poses" vibe.
Real people who happen to be beautiful — not CGI models.
